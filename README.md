## The source of inspiration  

The story has as a source of inspiration a short philosophical fiction  “The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas”  written by  American writer Ursula K. Le Guin. In this story, the narrator depicts a  summer festival  in  the  utopian  city of  Omelas, whose prosperity depends on the perpetual misery of a single child.  

## Our story  

The city in which the story takes place is named ***Emissarium*** (taken from caprum [emissarium](https://www.wordsense.eu/emissarium/) which means “scapegoat” in Latin and has its origin from the words [ēmissiō](https://www.wordsense.eu/emissio/#Latin) - “ejection, sending away” and [ārium](https://www.wordsense.eu/-arium/#Latin) - “place for”.  

Our character is a traveller who gets into this city due to some circumstances.
